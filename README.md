# TerrariaManager

## What
TerrariaManager as the name suggests is a script that allows you to manage your terraria servers.

With the tool you can (so far)
- Create Servers
- Remove Servers
- Start Servers
- Quit Servers
- Restart Servers

## How
TerrariaManager is written using shell script or BASH. The script makes use of tmux to allow the running of multiple servers simultaneously.

This tool has been written and tested on Linux.
I will test using MacOS and WSL soon.

## Roadmap
- [] Server Version Control
- [] Check Server Status
- [] Default options for server creation (if user leaves blank)
